Capillary Tube Analysis

This project is a Python script that calculates the length of a capillary tube required to achieve a desired refrigerant flow rate for a given set of operating conditions. The script uses thermodynamic properties of R410A refrigerant to simulate the flow of refrigerant through the capillary tube.

Prerequisites
The following Python packages are required to run this script:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scipy

Usage
To run the script, simply execute the capillary_tube_sizing.py file. The script will prompt the user to enter the required input parameters, such as the condensing and evaporator temperatures, mass flow rate, and capillary tube diameter.

The script will then calculate the length of the capillary tube required to achieve the desired refrigerant flow rate, as well as generate several graphs that show the relationship between capillary tube length and various other parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and Reynolds number.
